Given a question about a 3D scene and a set of available images from different camera angles, select  viewpoint IDs that provide the best visual evidence to answer the question.

- Question: {{ question }}
- Available view IDs: {{ view_ids }}
1. Target Localization: Identify the key objects or regions mentioned in the question.
2. View Selection Logic:
   - For Object Properties: Choose close-up views or views with the clearest line-of-sight (minimal occlusion).
   - For Spatial Relationships: Choose views or multiple views that capture all relevant objects .
   - For Occluded Objects: Choose views from opposing angles to "see behind" obstacles.
3. Redundancy Reduction: Avoid selecting multiple views that offer nearly identical perspectives; prioritize diversity in angles.

Output Format
selected views: A, B, C, ...;
(Note: Replace A, B, C with the actual numeric or string IDs from the list)
